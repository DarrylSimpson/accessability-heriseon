# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Goals

# GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Given the code I fixed non working header links to sections on the page.
Gave the HTML a semantic structure for its elements so its easier to read and comprehend.
Changed CSS to reflect the changes in the HTML.
